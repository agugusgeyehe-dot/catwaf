CatAI is a small local assistant built into this dashboard. It answers from CatWAF's own documentation and can see your real, current settings — the security score, whether the engine is on, what's blocked — so answers reflect your actual system, not a generic guide.

## What it can do

- Answer questions about how CatWAF's features work, in plain language.
- Look at your real configuration to answer things like "is my site actually protected?"
- Carry out requests that make protection **stronger** immediately — "block traffic from China," "set paranoia to 3," "turn on rate limiting" — with a one-click Undo right after.
- Offer to carry out requests that would make protection **weaker** — allowing an IP through, unblocking something — but always asks you to confirm first. It never does those silently.

## What it deliberately can't do

Some things aren't in its toolbox at all — not hidden behind a confirmation, just not reachable: turning the engine off, switching to detection-only, or disabling rate limiting. For those, it'll explain what the setting does and point you to the real control, because a change that reduces your protection is a decision worth making deliberately, on the actual settings page.

## Privacy

CatAI runs entirely on this machine via Ollama. Your questions, your settings, and your traffic data never leave the server — there's no cloud API involved.

## Memory

Each question is answered fresh — CatAI doesn't currently remember earlier messages in the conversation. If a follow-up needs context from what you asked before, just include it again in your next message.

## It can be wrong

CatAI runs on a small model so it stays fast on modest hardware. It's good at explaining CatWAF's own features accurately, but treat any specific recommendation as a suggestion to verify, not a final answer — especially before applying something you're not sure about.
